<h1>Styling</h1>
<p>
  If you ever end up writing your own CSS, it&#x27;s worth to know several
  things.
</p>
<h2>Mobile first approach</h2>
<p>
  We try to write frontend code for mobile and then use media queries for bigger
  breakpoints. You can read more about it in Responsiveness section.
</p>
<h2>SCSS</h2>
<p>
  We use SCSS as a CSS preprocessor. So you can use all the magic that SCSS
  offers.
</p>
<h2>CSS Variables</h2>
<p>
  Even though we use SCSS, we prefer to use native CSS variables because they
  are more flexible. You should be able to view all variables we have in
  <code>app/assets/stylesheets/config/_variables.scss</code> file. Since this
  file is imported everywhere, you should not need to import that by your own.
</p>
<p>
  Fun fact: there&#x27;s one exception to that: responsiveness breakpoints.
  Since you can&#x27;t use a CSS variables when defining a media query, this is
  the only case when we use SCSS variables. It&#x27;s just easier.
</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>
  DEV support multiple themes so you should always test your work against all
  themes. We have a file with all color variables and each theme has its own
  too.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Default theme: <code>app/assets/stylesheets/config/_colors.scss</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Other themes (minimal, night, pink, hacker):
    <code>app/assets/stylesheets/themes</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Import.scss</h2>
<p>
  When you create a new SCSS file you may want to import one file at the top of
  your new file: <code>app/assets/stylesheets/config/_import.scss</code>
  - it contains some helpers as well as breakpoint variables I mentioned
  earlier.
</p>
<h2>Folders</h2>
<p>
  You can access all of the SCSS files in
  <code>app/assets/stylesheets</code> folder.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>/base</code> - this folder contains some fundamental styling for
    layouts, resets and icons.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>/components</code> - this folder contains separate SCSS file for each
    component we have... tags, buttons, forms, ...
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>/config</code> - this folder contains bunch of configuration files.
    These are worth explaining:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>_colors.scss</code> - I mentioned it couple lines above - it
        contains all color variables used in Crayons.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>_generator.scss</code> - it&#x27;s basically a huge SCSS mixin
        generating ALL our utility classes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>_import.scss</code> - it contains bunch of helpers for SCSS as
        well as media breakpoints variables.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>_variables.scss</code> - it contains all CSS native variables.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>/themes</code> - this folder contains color declarations for other
    themes.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Other folders and top level files are mostly legacy... :) We still use them,
    but slowly trying to move all the styling to appropriate Crayons-related
    files. Exceptions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>crayons.scss</code> - this is one importing everything
        Crayons-related like variables, components styling, utility classes etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>minimal.scss</code> - this one is actually one of the main
        stylesheets from pre-Crayons era. It imports everything basically :).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
