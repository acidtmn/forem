<h1>Components</h1>
<p>
  DEV is a Rails application. Most of what we build for views uses ERB templates
  (*.html.erb files). We also build out parts of or sometimes complete views
  using
  <a href="https://docs.dev.to/frontend/preact">Preact</a>, typically for the
  logged on user experience. For example, the main page feed.
</p>
<p>
  Because of that, we components that are written in pure HTML &amp; CSS as well
  as Preact.
</p>
<h3>BEM class naming</h3>
<p>
  The entire design system uses the
  <a href="http://getbem.com/naming">BEM</a> methodology for naming CSS classes.
  Even Preact components under the hood use it.
</p>
<h3>crayons-*</h3>
<p>
  Crayons is the name of our design system. All Crayons components use the
  <code>crayons-</code> prefix. It&#x27;s useful because we can easily identify
  what <strong>IS</strong> and what <strong>IS NOT</strong> a Crayons component.
  It&#x27;s also practical because Crayons was implemented when we already had
  tons of other frontend classes in the codebase. It prevents overwriting styles
  by other CSS and it&#x27;s very unlikely someone has ever created a
  <code>.crayons-btn</code> style BUT it&#x27;s very likely someone has created
  <code>.btn</code> style...
</p>
<h2>HTML &amp; CSS Components</h2>
<p>
  You&#x27;ll need to copy piece of html code responsible for rendering a
  component and that&#x27;s it. Imagine a simple button component. The code
  below will render a <strong>primary button</strong> with specific styling:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;button class=&quot;crayons-btn&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/button&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  Crayons offers different variants for a button. A button can be one of the
  following variants: primary, secondary, outlined, danger, ghost, with icon,
  and so on. All of the components and its variations are described in the
  Components section.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you need a small (size <strong>s</strong> ),
  <strong>secondary</strong> type. In this case you will need to apply specific
  modifier class for that:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;button class=&quot;crayons-btn crayons-btn--secondary
    crayons-btn--s&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/button&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
<h2>Preact Components</h2>
<p>
  The same button above that was created with pure HTML using modifying classes
  is also a Preact component.
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    import &#123; Button &#125; from &#x27;@crayons&#x27;; //... &lt;Button
    size=&quot;s&quot; variant=&quot;secondary&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;Button&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  To import a design system component, e.g. <code>&lt;Button /&gt;</code>,
  import it from <code>@crayons</code>. Instead of modifying CSS classes, modify
  props, e.g. <code>variant=&quot;primary&quot;</code>.
</p>
