# Introduction to Crayons

Crayons is the design system of Forem. Defining our design language and
front-end approach, Crayons provides you everything you need to quickly design,
build, and ship coherent experience and style across Forem.

Crayons consists of libraries of:

- **Components** to create reusable features and views, such as buttons, form
  elements, tabs, and more.

- **Utility-first CSS classes** to let developers write front-end code almost
  without touching a single CSS file.
