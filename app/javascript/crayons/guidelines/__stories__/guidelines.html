<h1>Crayons</h1>
<p>
  Crayons is the design system of DEV. It will provide you everything you need
  to quickly design, build, and ship coherent experience and style across DEV.
</p>
<p>
  In other words - Crayons defines our design language and frontend approach.
</p>
<p>Crayons is a combination of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Components</strong>
    to create features or views. Think of buttons, form elements, tabs, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Utility-first CSS classes</strong>
    enabling developers to create frontend code almost without touching CSS.

<h2>How to best use Crayons?</h2>
<p>
  Imagine you have to build a new feature or a view. A designer will likely give
  you a mockup and there are several scenarios that can happen:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Mockup uses existing components.</strong>
    In that case you should be able to simply copy and paste code responsible
    for rendering specific component and call it a day.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Mockup uses existing components but they look customized a little.
    </strong>
    You have two options:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Copy and paste component code and customize it with
        <em>utility-first classes</em>
        . It makes sense if you need to make small changes like increase
        padding, make border thicker etc...
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consider extending existing component to support your case. This is more
        time-consuming solution because you should make sure it&#x27;s
        context-agnostic - so it should work in any context, not only for your
        feature.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Mockup doesn&#x27;t use existing components.</strong>
    Looks like you will have to build everything from scratch. And you have two
    options again:
    <ul>
      <li>
        You may either build it using
        <em>utility-first classes</em>
        , so you don&#x27;t have to be worried where to put CSS or how to
        structure it.
        <em>Utility-first classes</em>
        should let you not only apply simple customizations like padding etc.
        but they should let you also create entire views.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can split your work - try to build some things with
        <em>utility-first classes</em>
        (so you can move on faster), but also consider building actual reusable
        components.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>It&#x27;s something completely new.</strong>
    You probably think you&#x27;ll have to write tons of custom CSS and import
    your .scss file somewhere. Well, hopefully not. As mentioned earlier,

    <em>utility-first classes</em>
    let you create even complex components without a single line of CSS. From a
    design point of view, this is the preferred way to write frontend code
    instead of creating new SCSS files. Every line of CSS you write, the more
    CSS we have to maintain, the more our users have to download, and the more
    bytes we have to host.
  </li>
</ul>
