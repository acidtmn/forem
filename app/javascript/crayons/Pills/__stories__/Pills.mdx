# Pills

Pill is an element representing a relatively short form of data, i.e. short label.
Pill would visually encapsulate such a data in... well, a _pill_.

Generally pills should occur in a herd üê∫. So it's type of data that you would expect to see as set of values.
For example, imagine a list of roles associated with some user's account. 
This could be represented as bunch of pills (of course depending on the context) - each pill being one role.

Pills could be used to simply represent some data but they can also have an action (only one action per pill) baked-in.

## Element

For the reason mentioned above, it is allowed for a pill to be used as one of the following elements:

- `button` - for actionable pill, in a way that would trigger some function ([read more about using Buttons vs Links](https://forem.team/pp/buttons-links-ctas-234e))
- `a` - for actionable pill, in a way that would take you to other location,
- `span` - for static representation of data,
- `li` - for static representation of data.

We set this limitation because of the nature of the pill - where and how it should occur.
This constraint should limit overusing it for undesignated scenarios.

## Icons

### Description Icon

If possible, this icon should represent the actual data associated with the Pill, 
e.g. if pill's value says "Cake" maybe the icon should also represent a cake.

### Action Icon

If possible, this icon should represent the action associated with the Pill, for example:

- if action associated with a pill is to edit its value, maybe the icon should be a "pen".
- if action associated with a pill is to remove it, maybe the icon should be a "x".

If there is no action associated with a pill (for example when using non-actionable `element`), 
consider not using this icon at all.

#### Destructive Icon

Using actionable pill with an action being designated to remove this specific data was a pretty common scenario.
For that reason, if you need such a pill toggling a prop `destructiveActionIcon` will set "x" icon as default for right icon
and will also apply appropriate styling.

If you need that "destructive" styling but want to use another icon, you can do it too:

```
<Pill
  destructiveActionIcon
  actionIcon={HideIcon}
  ...
>
...
</Pill>
```

## Tooltip

By passing a string or node in `tooltip` prop, button will get a custom tooltip (visually different than a classic `title`) on `:hover` and `:focus`.
The tooltip makes up part of the "accessible name" used by assistive technologies like screen readers. 
If you _do not_ wish the tooltip to be part of the accessible name, consider wrapping it in a `<span aria-hidden="true">`.
Tooltips can be temporarily dismissed on `Escape` key press.
