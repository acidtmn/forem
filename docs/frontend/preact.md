# Writing Preact Tests

Preact is an alternative to React with the same modern API. Preact components are packaged using webpacker and the preact code is located in `/app/javascript`

The test code is located within the same directory as the compontent
called `__tests__` so for example

`app/javascripts/articl-form/__tests__`

The testing library being used is `jest`. To run jest tests:

```
npm run test
```
