# CodeClimate

We are using CodeClimate to track code quality and code coverage. Codeclimate will grade the quality of the code of every PR but not the entirety of the project. If you feel that the current linting rule is unreasonable, feel free to submit a _separate_ PR to change it. Fix any errors that CodeClimate provides and strive to leave code better than you found it.

Travis will upload Simplecov data to CodeClimate. We are still in the early stage of using it so it may not provide an accurate measurement our of codebase.
