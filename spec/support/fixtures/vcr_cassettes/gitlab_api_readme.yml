        ## Requirements

        Please see the [requirements documentation](doc/install/requirements.md) for system requirements and more information about the supported operating systems.

        ## Installation

        The recommended way to install GitLab is with the [Omnibus packages](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/) on our package server.
        Compared to an installation from source, this is faster and less error prone.
        Just select your operating system, download the respective package (Debian or RPM) and install it using the system's package manager.

        There are various other options to install GitLab, please refer to the [installation page on the GitLab website](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/) for more information.

        ## Contributing

        GitLab is an open source project and we are very happy to accept community contributions. Please refer to [Contributing to GitLab page](https://about.gitlab.com/contributing/) for more details.

        ## Install a development environment

        To work on GitLab itself, we recommend setting up your development environment with [the GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit).
        If you do not use the GitLab Development Kit you need to install and setup all the dependencies yourself, this is a lot of work and error prone.
        One small thing you also have to do when installing it yourself is to copy the example development unicorn configuration file:

            cp config/unicorn.rb.example.development config/unicorn.rb

        Instructions on how to start GitLab and how to run the tests can be found in the [getting started section of the GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit#getting-started).

        ## Software stack

        GitLab is a Ruby on Rails application that runs on the following software:

        - Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS/RHEL/OpenSUSE
        - Ruby (MRI) 2.6.5
        - Git 2.8.4+
        - Redis 2.8+
        - PostgreSQL 9.6+

        For more information please see the [architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html) and [requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html) documentation.

        ## UX design

        Please adhere to the [UX Guide](doc/development/ux_guide/index.md) when creating designs and implementing code.

        ## Third-party applications

        There are a lot of [third-party applications integrating with GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/applications/). These include GUI Git clients, mobile applications and API wrappers for various languages.

        packages\u003c/a\u003e on our package server.\nCompared to an installation
        from source, this is faster and less error prone.\nJust select your operating
